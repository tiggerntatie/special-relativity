    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The twin paradox supposes a scenario where an astronaut embarks on a journey near the speed of light, leaving their twin counterpart behind on Earth. Due to the time dilation effect that occurs when traveling at high speeds, the astronaut experiences the journey as a shorter time than the counterpart on Earth and returns younger than their twin. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the paradox, you need only ask what makes the astronaut so special? Why can't the twin on Earth be regarded as the one in motion, and why aren't the roles reversed, making the astronaut the one who is older at the end of the journey? The symmetry of the situation seems to demand that neither twin will be older than the other when the journey is finished!\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution of this apparent paradox hinges on the full use of the Lorentz Transformations, rather than a simplistic application of the time dilation effect."

    "So the predicted time dilation still occurs for the traveling astronaut. Why? If the astronaut could observe the clocks on the Earth and at the star, wouldn't they also appear to be going slower?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer, surely, is yes, but the relativity of simultaneity throws a wrinkle into the problem. As soon as the astronaut is accelerated to their travel speed, they would testify that the stopwatches on the Earth and at the remote star *are no longer synchronized*. In fact, it would appear that the stopwatch at the remote star was started *before* the stopwatch on Earth was. Thus, when the astronaut arrives at the remote star the stopwatch will report a longer time because it appears to have started long before the journey even began! On the return journey, the situation is reversed and the Earth stopwatch appears to have been started before the star's stopwatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that result seems nonsensical, then go back and think about the simultaneity effect in the [simultaneity](./simultaneity.html) notebook. Once you understand how two events that are clearly simultaneous in one frame of reference can be clearly **not** simultaneous to an observer in a different frame, then the statement about the stopwatches will make perfect sense!"
