    "If it is true that the speed of light (denoted using the symbol $c$) is a constant everywhere, then it should be possible to make a *really awesome clock* using a light emitter, a mirror and a detector -- all inside a glass vacuum chamber (to ensure that the speed of light is used in a *vacuum*).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it is first turned on, the clock emits a brief pulse of light, aimed at a mirror some distance, $d$, away from it, inside the vacuum chamber. The pulse of light travels through the chamber, is reflected from the mirror, and returns to its starting position where the detector detects it. Upon detecting the light pulse, the clock immediately tells the emitter to send another pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the clock is really *awesome* because its parts are temperature controlled, to ensure the distance $d$ remains constant, and because the light itself always travels at the same speed. The rate at which the clock \"ticks\" is now easy to calculate:\n",

    "$$f_{clock} = \\frac 1 {T_{clock}} = \\frac 1 {\\frac {2d} c} = \\frac c {2d}$$\n",

So as you watch the spacecraft zipping by and you watch the light pulse bouncing back and forth it actually makes a slight zig-zag motion, because it is moving sideways while the pulse of light is moving down and up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the beam of light that you see is *still* moving at the speed of light, $c$, the *vertical* component of its motion, $c_y$ is reduced, while the horizontal component of its motion $c_x$ is the same as the spaceship velocity, $v$. So Pythagoras would say:\n",

Each participant (astronaut and grounded observer) sees the other traveling at 8/10 the speed of light. No one player should be *special* and have their clock slowed down relative to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to resolve this paradox, you have to consider some additional weird consequences of the fact that the speed of light in a vacuum *never changes*: do things traveling close to the speed of light change their length (**length contraction**), and can observer and astronaut even agree on when certain events occurred (**simultaneity**)?"
