    "For this, let's assume you are observing the spaceship from the ground and you don't know how long the gap in the clock is supposed to be. You see the spaceship going by and observe that the length of the clock appears to be $d_0$. The clock is oriented so the pulse emitter is facing forward and as the clock emits its pulse, you see the pulse racing out ahead of the emitter. As the spaceship goes faster, it is clear that it is going to take longer and longer for the pulse to get to the mirrored end, because it too is moving away in front of the pulse. As long as the spaceship never travels faster than light itself, the pulse will eventually reach the reflector. \n",
