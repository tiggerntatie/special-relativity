# special-relativity

An exploration of the thought experiments of Einstein's 
special relavity and how they can be used to explain
the [relativity of simultaneity](./simultaneity.html) and derive the Lorentz 
Transformations for [time dilation](./time-dilation.html) and [length contraction](./length-contraction.html).
The Lorentz Transformations will explain the so-called 
[Twin Paradox by means of a practical example](./twin-paradox.html).
