# special-relativity

An exploration of the thought experiments of [Einstein's 
special](https://netdenizen.org/specialrelativity) relavity and how they can be used to explain
the [relativity of simultaneity](https://netdenizen.org/specialrelativity/simultaneity.html) and derive the Lorentz 
Transformations for [time dilation](https://netdenizen.org/specialrelativity/time-dilation.html) and [length contraction](https://netdenizen.org/specialrelativity/length-contraction.html).
The Lorentz Transformations will explain the so-called 
[Twin Paradox by means of a practical example](https://netdenizen.org/specialrelativity/twin-paradox.html).
